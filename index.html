                <h2 class="text-center">Chicken</h2>
                <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Chicken is always included in a healthy diet because it is a lean meat, which means it doesn't have much fat. Eating chicken regularly can actually help you lose weight in a healthy way. Apart from protein, chicken is also full of calcium and phosphorus.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Beef</h2>
                <p>Beef is meat from a cow. It's also a word for a complaint. If you have a beef with someone, you're not sharing a steak; you have a gripe. Beef is a type of meat from cattle. In general, red meats (beef, pork, and lamb) have more saturated (bad) fat than chicken, fish, and vegetable proteins such as beans. Saturated and trans fats can raise your blood cholesterol and make heart disease worse.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Sushi</h2>
                <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Sushi is often regarded as a weight-loss-friendly meal. To make your next sushi meal more filling, try accompanying it with miso soup, edamame, sashimi, or wakame salad. Sushi often boasts high-fat sauces and toppings but relatively small amounts of vegetables or fish.</p>
